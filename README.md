# Adversarial-Examples-on-Meshes
This repository contains the code for my Master's Thesis, which consists in developing a way to generalize adversarial perturbations on meshes.

## Dependencies
### PyTorch 1.4
This project uses **PyTorch** in order to compute gradients and use accelerated hardware, hence a version of pytorch equal to **1.4** should be used.

### Other packages
All other packages can be installed by running

	pip install -r requirements.txt

### CUDA KNN (optional)
In order to compute the nearest neighbors and chamfer distance, a CUDA implementation of KNN is used. It can be installed using 
	
	git clone https://github.com/unlimblue/KNN_CUDA.git
	cd KNN_CUDA
	make && make install
This dependency is necessary with some types of adversarial losses, otherwise it can be skipped.

## Dataset Data
The data for the dataset can be downloaded at the following pages:
 * [FAUST](http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de/)
 * [CoMA](https://coma.is.tue.mpg.de/) (only the registered scan are required).
 * [SMAL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nuPxP4mtGyx0eLrppW3TVbWAAE6vtFzv/view?usp=sharing) (this was generated by us using the parameters available at http://smal.is.tue.mpg.de)
 * [SHREC14](http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/shaperetrieval/shrec14/) (we used the *real* dataset in our experiments)

Once downloaded put the data inside a subfolder named `raw` inside a root folder choosen by you; *e.g.* if  `/home/faust` is the root directory for the dataset, then the downloaded data should be put in `/home/faust/raw`).

## Pre-trained Parameters
The pre-trained parametes for the classifiers can be found [here]().
Pass this data in input when instantiating a classifier.
For a more in detail explanation, look at this two tutorials:
 * [tutorial with ChebyNet](notebooks/tutorial.ipynb)
 * [tutorial with PointNet](notebooks/tutorial_PointNet.ipynb)

**NOTE:**

*Unfortunately due to compatibility reasons, most of the code done on CoMA is
not currently available. I will try to integrate it in the repository as soon
as I have more time.*
